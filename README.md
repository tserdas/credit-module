<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project focuses on developing a backend Loan API for a banking system, enabling bank employees to manage and
process customer loans. The API provides endpoints for creating, listing, and paying loans, offering a seamless way for
employees to handle customer financials. Key functionalities include:

Create Loan: The API allows employees to create a new loan for a customer by specifying the loan amount, interest rate,
and number of installments. The system ensures that the customer has sufficient credit to take out the loan.
Installments are constrained to specific periods (6, 9, 12, or 24 months), and interest rates are restricted between 0.1
and 0.5. The total loan amount is calculated based on the provided amount and interest rate, and the due dates for
installments are set to the first day of each month.

List Loans: Employees can retrieve a list of loans associated with a given customer, with optional filters such as the
number of installments or whether the loan has been paid off.

List Installments: The API provides an endpoint to list the installments of a specific loan, giving a clear view of the
payment schedule.

Pay Loan: This endpoint enables employees to process installment payments for a loan. The system ensures that
installments are paid in full; partial payments are not allowed. If the payment amount exceeds the installment amount,
the excess is used to pay subsequent installments, with the earliest installments paid first. The API restricts payments
to installments that are due within the current month and the previous two months. A detailed response is returned,
including the number of installments paid, the total amount spent, and whether the loan is fully paid.

This backend service integrates with customer, loan, and installment data to ensure accurate financial tracking, and it
supports efficient loan management for bank employees.

<!-- INFO -->

## Info

* Project test coverage is %86
* The customer table should be filled manually because limit information is needed. The scenario could be that the
  customer onboarding process and the allocation process already fill this table. So customer 1 is manually saved while
  the project is running.
* Bonus 2 added to project but Bonus 1 not. Current version authorized with an admin user and password.
